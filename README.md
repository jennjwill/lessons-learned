###Things I've Learned at Bloc.io

1. basic HTML
2. basic CSS
3. what my computer's terminal is
4. a little of what the heck Git is
5. the meaning of a bunch of new (to me) terms and ideas, like bash, repositories, commit (I thought bloc was misspelling "comment" LOL), better ways to use slack, how to share my screen in Zoom...
